Get and Unpack the TYPO3 Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Download the matching package for your requirements from
   `http://typo3.org/download/ <http://typo3.org/download/>`_
   (If you are not sure which package you should choose read the
   section ":ref:`which-package-and-which-file-format`" in the in-depth
   part of the manual).

#. Upload this package to your webserver and unpack its contents.

   .. tip::

      You can also unpack the package on your local PC and *then* upload the
      *unpacked* contents. However, the package contains thousands of files,
      so if you're able to unzip or untar the package on the server, better
      do that!

#. Hit the site with your browser and the Install Tool will open (
   `http://www.example.com/typo3/install/index.php?mode=123&step=1&password=joh316
