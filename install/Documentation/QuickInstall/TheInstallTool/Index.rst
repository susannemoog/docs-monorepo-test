The Install Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Install Tool is located in 'typo3/install/' and should
automatically start in "1-2-3"-mode with password 'joh316', if you
have not set up any database for the site.

In other words, this is what you should see:

.. figure:: ../../Images/Quick-1-2-3-Start.png
   :alt: Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode.

*Click "Continue".*

.. figure:: ../../Images/Quick-1-2-3-First-Step.png
   :alt: Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, first step.

*Enter your database credentials.*

.. figure:: ../../Images/Quick-1-2-3-Second-Step.png
   :alt: Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, second step.

*Create a new database for TYPO3 or use an existing empty
database.*

.. figure:: ../../Images/Quick-1-2-3-Third-Step.png
   :alt: Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, third step.

*Import the default database tables.*

.. figure:: ../../Images/Quick-1-2-3-Finished.png
   :alt: Install Tool in 1-2-3 mode, installation finished.

*The basic installation is now complete.*

After you finished the basic installation procedure, TYPO3 basically
is working. However, there still are options, which have not been
configured yet. We therefore recommend to go to the install tool in
normal mode to change the install tool password and to verify the
details of your configuration. Click the "Configure TYPO3" link to do
so.

You can find more information in the section "In-Depth Installation",
subsection "The Install Tool" below.
