From DAM to FAL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have been working with "DAM" (Digital Asset Management) in TYPO3
4.5 or 4.7, you will want to migrate your data to the core "FAL" (File
Abstraction Layer). DAM and its related extensions no longer work with
TYPO3 CMS 6.x.

- Install the extension
  `dam_falmigration <https://github.com/b13/t3ext-dam_falmigration>`_.

.. todo: replace this link with the extension link to TER once it's
   published

- Read its documentation to learn about its capabilities and usage.
