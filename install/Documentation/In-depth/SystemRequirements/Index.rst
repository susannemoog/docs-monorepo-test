System Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 requires a webserver, PHP and a database system.

* TYPO3 requires a webserver, which can run PHP (e.g. Apache or IIS).
* TYPO3 6.1 requires at least PHP 5.3.7.
* It can be used with a great many of database systems. If you use
  MySQL, you will need MySQL 5.1 at least.

If you use the Apache webserver, you the module mod_rewrite should be
activated. Certain PHP extensions are necessary, others recommended.
You possibly want to adjust the memory limit; at least 128 MB are
recommended. If you want to do some image processing, you need
GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick 6 or newer. A detailed list of these
requirements is enclosed in the file INSTALL.txt inside each TYPO3
package.

Should you encounter problems, the ":ref:`trouble-shooting`" section at
the end of this document helps you.
