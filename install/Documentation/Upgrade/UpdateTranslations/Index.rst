Update Translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the Backend, go to the module "Language" and update your
translations. If you don't update your translations, new texts will
only be displayed in English to you. (The translations are available,
after the `Translation Team`_ for your language has translated the
texts.)
