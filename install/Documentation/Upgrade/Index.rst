Upgrade
-------

When a new version of TYPO3 is released, you should follow the
guideline in this chapter in order to do an upgrade. Also follow any
additional upgrade information carefully. You might e.g. want to skim
the included ChangeLog to see if any features affect the way your site
works. (Look for lines prepended with "!!!" - those are the really
important ones!)

Basically these are the steps to be done to update your TYPO3 site:
