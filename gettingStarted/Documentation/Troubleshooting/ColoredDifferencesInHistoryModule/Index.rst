Colored differences in history module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get colored differences in the history module, you need to have
the UNIX tool *diff* installed on your server. Otherwise you will not
get colored differences. Anyway, you will be able to see the differences but
without being colored.
