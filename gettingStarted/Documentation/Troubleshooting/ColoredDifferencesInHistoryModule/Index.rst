Colored differences in history module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get the colored differences in the history module, you need to have
installed the unix-tool diff on your server. Otherwise you will not
get the colored differences. But you will be able to see the
differences, just without colors.
