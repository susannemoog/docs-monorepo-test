Note on image processing in TYPO3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you do not see some or all images in the screenshots probably ImageMagick or
GraphicsMagic are not detected or properly installed on your server. Presumably
you do not see all the great things happen.

In this case you need to consult the :ref:`installation documentation <t3install:start>`
which contains more information on that topic.

Also remember the `mailing list for installation <http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-
bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-install>`_ questions.
