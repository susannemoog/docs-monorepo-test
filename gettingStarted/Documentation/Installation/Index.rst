Prerequisite
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should have a fully configured and ready web server meeting the
requirements you find at `http://typo3.org/about/typo3-the-cms/system-requirements/
<http://typo3.org/about/typo3-the-cms/system-requirements/>`_.

If you do not have a web server and you are running a Windows
operation system, you might want to try the
`TYPO3Winstaller <http://typo3winstaller.sourceforge.net/>`_,
which will install a web
server and the Introduction Package on your local computer.

Make sure to have your database credentials ready.
