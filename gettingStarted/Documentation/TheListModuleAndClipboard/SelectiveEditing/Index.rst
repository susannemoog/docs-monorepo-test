Selective editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The list module also uses the check boxes for elements for another
purpose - selective multi-editing. To enable this you must first of
all click the title of the table in the List module (#1):

This will enable the extended mode. Here you can select additional
fields from the table you want to view as well (#2). Select the "Type"
field for now. This will make the "Type" field appear in addition to
the "Header" field already there.

.. _editing-all-headers:

Editing all headers
"""""""""""""""""""

Simply click the little pencil next to the "Header" label:

You will see this next:

This feature allows you to edit the same field from a large number of
records in one stroke of the pen! Very comfortable!

You can do the same for both the Header and Type field at one time -
just use another edit-pencil:

The result will be almost the same form - but with an additional
field:

Now, activate the clipboard and select one of the numeric clipboards:

The really cool thing is if you tick off only  *some* of the listed
records:

.. figure:: ../../Images/manual_html_349b298f.png
   :alt:

Then you will - guessed it? - only get to edit those two!

Powerful stuff.

Now do the math yourself for the rest of the buttons! Play around with
them now that you have the chance with this test website.
