The List module and Clipboard
-----------------------------

The List module contains some very powerful features for managing the
database content. Let's just think about it for a moment: All the page
and page content related business went on in the Page module - it was
designed for that! All template editing we did was done in the
Template module - it was designed for that! But on the lower level,
behind the scenes, the List module is the ultimate place to manage
both pages, page content elements, template records, domain records,
users and groups, news items and whatever elements TYPO3 is capable of
managing!
