^^^^^^^^^^

TSconfig Reference
  :ref:`TSconfig <t3tsconfig:start>` covers both
  *Page-TSconfig* and *User-TSconfig*, with which you are able to change the behavior of
  the **backend** in parts. You can change labels, hide or show fields, set
  permissions and default values. Usually this will be done in the *Page-TSconfig*
  or *User-TSconfig* fields. This reference explains which options are available in
  TYPO3 CMS.

TypoScript Reference
  The :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:start>` defines different functions and objects which can
  be used to configure the **frontend's** output. Usually you will use an extension's
  configuration for all built-in content elements. If you would like to change
  something you can look up the possible options in the *TSRef*.
