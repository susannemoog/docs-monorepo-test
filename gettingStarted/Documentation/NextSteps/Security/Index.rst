Keep security in mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Security is taken very seriously by the developers of TYPO3 CMS. The
`TYPO3 Security Team
<http://typo3.org/teams/security/>`_ manages possible security
incidents. They review it and consider its impact. If TYPO3 CMS or an
extension turns out to be actually vulnerable, the Security Team works
on a fix for the problem. They contact the extension's author(s) and when
the fix is tested and released, an advisory will be published.

To get the bulletin notifications delivered to your inbox, we strongly recommend
to `subscribe <http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce>`_
to the `typo3-announce mailing list <http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce>`_ .

The TYPO3 Security Team also provides some `Educational Resources
<http://typo3.org/teams/security/resources/>`_ about securing your
TYPO3 installation.
