Keep security in mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Security is taken very seriously by the developers of TYPO3. The
`TYPO3 Security Team
<http://typo3.org/teams/security/>`_ manages possible security
incidents. They review it and considers its impact. If TYPO3 or an
extension turns out to be actually vulnerable, the Security Team work
on a fix for the problem. They contact the extension authors and if
the fix is tested and released, an advisory is published. To get the
bulletin notification delivered to your inbox, we strongly recommend
to `subscribe <http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-
bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce>`_ to the typo3-announce mailing
list. The TYPO3 Security Team also provides some
`additional resources
<http://typo3.org/teams/security/resources/>`_ about securing your
TYPO3 installation.
