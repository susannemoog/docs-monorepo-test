TYPO3 has a lot of documentation available on the
`documentation web site <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/>`_.
The TYPO3 CMS documentation is divided into several sections:

1. The **Tutorials** section covers documents which provide step-by-step
   introductions to specific topics.
2. If you need documentation about installing TYPO3 CMS or related software
   you will find it in the **Guides** section.
3. The **Reference** section is related to the core of TYPO3 and mainly
   describes the things behind the scenes of technology. Target groups of this
   documentation are extension developers and core developers.
4. In the section **Extension Manuals** you will find a list of all manuals
   available for extensions.

This is a huge number of different documents and beginners may find it a little
bit confusing to find the right document to get started. Therefore we recommend
the following documents for further studies:
