During this lengthy document you might have wondered time and again -
how can I change the title? Or how can I put in my own logo.

Before we look at these issues you must understand something
fundamental about how most CMS work: they separate content from
presentation. This means the pages and content are stored in the
database without any colors or fonts or background images attached to
them. That information is instead located in the template and
stylesheets which normally apply to the whole website when pages are
shown. Thus a single change in the template will affect the overall
appearance of the website for all pages. This is a great and very
important feature of a CMS! Just ask people who made an html file
based website with 100+ pages and wanted to make a redesign...
