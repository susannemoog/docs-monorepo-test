Backend and Frontend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*TYPO3 CMS* is divided into two areas - the backend and the frontend.
The *frontend* is the website that is produced by *TYPO3 CMS*. It is
visible by everyone out there on the web.
The administrative area of the website is called *backend*. A username
and a password is always required for the backend.
You will later learn how to give :ref:`access to the backend to others
<creating-a-new-user-for-the-introduction-site>`
- like editors or co-administrators.

To go to the frontend, enter http://www.your-site.example.org/ in
your address bar. For now we continue with the backend.

Go to the backend of your new website: open a browser and type
http://www.your-site.example.org/typo3/\.

You will get a login page looking like this:

   :alt: Login page for the backend

Use the username **admin** and the password you set while installing
*TYPO3 CMS*.

After pressing the **login** button you will get redirected to the TYPO3
backend overview.

On the left you have TYPO3's main modules - the main menu of the
backend. Click on Web > **Page** to go to the *page module now*.
